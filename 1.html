    JACK : No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.<br>
    ROSE : I'm so cold.<br>
    JACK : You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?<br>
    ROSE : I can't feel my body.<br>
    JACK : Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me.<br>
    JACK : It brought me to you. And I'm thankful, Rose. I'm Thankful.<br>
    JACK : You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.
